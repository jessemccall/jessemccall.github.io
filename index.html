   <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
      <p>I am in my fifth professional year currently working for Stantec in Brisbane since achieving a bachelors’ 
        degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Canterbury. My solidified experience spans through water, transport, and geotechnical areas, although my passion lies most 
        within the water and transport disciplines. These are the areas I aim to specialise in as my career develops.</p>
      <p>My overarching personal attributes are to always strive to deliver the best quality outputs, to work 
      consistently hard every day, and to develop and learn with a holistic lens always. At this time of my career 
      my focus is on honing in my technical skills, obtaining professional accreditation (CPEng), and progressing into a 
      project or design manager of civil engineering projects. My ultimate career goal is to be an exceptionally technically skilled civil engineer,
        as well as a personal and purpose-led project or design manager, and eventual team leader.

        <section id='education'>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>In high school, design technology was my most favourite subject and I placed first in year 12 and second in year 13 out of my year group. Design technology was my favourite because I enjoyed planning, designing, and building my own projects which I still do at home today. 
        This was my main inspiration to pursue engineering. I am passionate about making ideas come into reality and into tangible uses that benefit the community.
      </p>
This passion led me to a Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree and subsequent continual professional development courses throughout my career. I’m a big believer in life-long learning and seek education opportunities where I can.

      <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I enjoy experiencing new things and trying new hobbies, because you never know where it might lead you. my favourite hobbies are to go kayaking/ kayak fishing, create furniture/ DIY projects, paint, or go to the gym.
        I am a big believer in self-improvement, and I set personal and professional goals which I try to achieve every year for self-betterment. </p>
              <p>I love travelling - I have gone across Uganda on a motorbike, Australia in a 4x4, parts of Indonesia and Europe.
              I also thoroughly enjoy all types of fishing from fly fishing on back-country rivers to sea fishing in the cook-strait. I like to play and follow various 
        sports: boxing, rugby union, basketball and tennis. </p>
