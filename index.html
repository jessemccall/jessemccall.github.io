   <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
      <p>I am in my fifth professional year currently working for Stantec in Brisbane since achieving a bachelors’ 
        degree in Civil Engineering with honours at the University of Canterbury. My job title is “Civil Engineer” 
        although my solidified experience spans through roading, water, and geotechnical areas. My passion lies most 
        within the water and roading industries and these are the areas I aim to specialise in as my career develops.
      </p>
      My overarching personal work attributes are to always strive to deliver the best quality outputs, to work 
      consistently hard every day, and to develop and learn with a holistic lens always. At this time of my career 
      my focus is on developing expertise in the technical skills I’ve obtained, and learning/ progressing into a 
      project manager of civil engineering projects. My ultimate career goal is to be exceptionally technically skilled 
      in water infrastructure projects, as well as to be an exceptional personal and purpose-led team leader and project 
      manager.

        <section id='education'>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>In high school, design technology was my most favourite subject and I placed first in year 12 and second in year 13 out of my year group. Design technology was my favourite because I enjoyed planning, designing, and building my own projects which I still do at home today. 
        This was my main inspiration to pursue engineering. I am passionate about making ideas come to fruition and into tangible uses that benefit the community.
This passion led me to a Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree at the University of Canterbury, and subsequent continual professional development courses while working at Tonkin + Taylor. I’m a big believer in life-long learning and seek education opportunities where I can so my learning to date is only a snapshot at time of writing this. 
      I have requested critical feedback throughout my career to continually strive for excellence and I can provide a summary of this feedback if desired. For a snap-shot list of my education history refer to Attachment B, and I can supply a full list of formalised courses I have completed while at T+T if desired. I can also send my university transcript on request if desired.  </p>

            <section id='interests and hobbies'>
      <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I enjoy experiencing new things as much as I can without discrimination, because you never know where it might lead you. I am a big believer in self-improvement, and I set personal and professional goals which I try to achieve every year for self-betterment.
        I love travelling, I have gone across Uganda on a motorbike, and I hope to also do Vietnam in the future. I thoroughly enjoy all types of fishing from fly fishing on back-country rivers to sea fishing in the cook-strait. I like to play and follow various 
        sports: boxing, rugby union, basketball and tennis. In my spare time I like learning various different hobbies, although my favourite hobbies are to go kayaking/ kayak fishing, create furniture/ DIY projects, paint, or go to the gym.</p>
